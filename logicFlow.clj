; To control logic we need operations
(true? true)
(false? true)
(nil? nil)

; Nil is treated as a logical false
; nil? tests for the abscence of values
; not tests for negation
; = tests for equality
; not= tests for inequality

(true? nil) ; treated as a logical false
(nil? 1);
(=(true? true?)) ; = tests equality
(not=(true? true?)) ; not tests for inequality

; what functions to use with collections
; empty? vectors, maps, lists
(empty? [:table :chair :door])
(empty? [])
(empty? {})

; Use seq to check for not empty
; because nil is logically false
(seq[])
